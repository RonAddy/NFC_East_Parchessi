# Project1_NFC-EAST-PARCHESSI

Explanations of the technologies used-->

3 languages- HTML, CSS, (Vanillia) Javascript

Approach taken-->

My original approach was to replicate the ludo (parchessi) game I always loved as a kid, and add my own touch to it 
using the NFC East teams. As the project went along, I noticied how much actually had to go into the game and was forced
to change up many things. In the end, what was supposed to be a four player game of parchessi turned into users only being able
to control the Eagles pieces and maneuver through the playing board dodging the other computer players.

User stories-->

(Being that I have been the only user so far), I do not have much critiques from others to evaluate my project and improve upon it.
I was told that my design was great, but persoanlly, I wanted this project to be about the functionaloty and manipulating many things
at once

How-to-use instructions-->

The alerts will help you go through the game. On load, you will be given a description of what the mission is and your first move is to click the dice. A six will allow you to move a piece from the 'sidelines' and after you make a move, the computer pieces will move randomly on the board. You roll the dice again after the computer moves to then move your pieces around. The object of the game is to move your pieces around the board and bring them into the 'endzone' before the other teams have a chance to bring you all back home.

Unsolved problems-->

Many bugs. Many. As of know, you can move all pieces onto the board at the same time once you roll a six. I wanted to make to movement of the pieces a little more smooth but I was not able to get that working. The computer pieces also happen to glitch certain times when they land on a spot you hace a piece on. Overall, the game is not close to where it needs to be but I have learned many things in this project.
